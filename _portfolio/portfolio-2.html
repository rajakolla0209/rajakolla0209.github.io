StyleGAN. This is done by inverting both images to W+ space with Perceptual loss based image inversion and taking
some vectors of W+ space from one image and rest from other and passing this to pretrained StyleGAN"

In this project, I combined styles of 2 different images to obtain a new image that has elements of both styles by using pretrained
StyleGAN. This is done by inverting both images to W+ space with Perceptual loss based image inversion and taking
some vectors of W+ space from one image and rest from other and passing this to pretrained StyleGAN.
